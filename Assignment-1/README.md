# Assignment 1

I chose to go to the webiste; [Shadertoy](http://shadertoy.com) and looked at the different shaders they had there. I really liked the shade4rs people made here as they were very colorful and complex. In particular this one [here](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/4scfR2) which is really impressive. it's also nice seeing the code next to its result, just qunatifying the work that went into it.
